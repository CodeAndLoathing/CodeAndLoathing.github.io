      <description>Credentials in PowerShell PSCredentials objects are widely used in PowerShell by both built-in and 3rd party cmdlets that require credentials as an argument.
To create a PSCredential object interactively we can use the Get-Credential cmdlet.

 $Credential = Get-Credential Connect-AzureAD -Credential $Credential  Non-interactive creation of PSCredential But an interactive prompt is not helpful if we want to automate something since the script will just hang waiting for input.</description>
