      <title>Skype for Business blurry during screenshare</title>

      <description>Sometimes when screensharing with Skype for Business the remotely presented screen will be blurry, but if the remote viewer requests control the screenshare will suddenly become clear.
If that is the case there&amp;rsquo;s probably something going wrong with the VbSS (Video based Screen Sharing) mechanism that Microsoft uses now in Skype for Business for screen sharing.
Forcing Skype to revert back to using RDP (which I&amp;rsquo;m guessing is also what happens when a user requests control) resolved the issue for me.</description>
